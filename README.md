## Overview

The goal of this project is to create an EDA that analyzes the correlation between stocks of video game publishers and industry-related events occurring between 2013 and 2023. Events in this analysis are defined as any media occurrences that contribute to the popularity of a publisherâ€™s game (ex: game review, game awards, etc.). This analysis is accomplished through the construction of a time-series dataset using web scraping.
