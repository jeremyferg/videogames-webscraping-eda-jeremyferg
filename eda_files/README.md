## EDA Files

These R-scripts provide the code used to create the various graphics and tables created in the final report. The final report's exploratory analysis is broken up to highlight each of the major data sets: `game_info`, `game_reviews`, ` game_awards`, and `esports`. Therefore the EDA scripts were separated based to reflect the EDA. Scripts are numbered according to their appearance on the report. Each R script provides concise detail regarding the functionality of the code.
