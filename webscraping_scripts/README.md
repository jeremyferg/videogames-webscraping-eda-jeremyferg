## Overview

The `webscraping_scripts` encompasses the R scripts used to collect the `game_info`, `game_reviews` and `game_awards` data sets. Specifically:

-   `game_awards_webscraping.R` --\> extracts data from Wikipedia to find `game_awards_raw`

-   `game_reviews_webscraping.R` --\> extracts data from OpenCritic to find `game_reviews_raw`

-   `videogame_info_webscraping.R` --\> extracts data from Wikipedia to find `game_info_raw`

The goal of each script is to extract data from each of these websites in a clean and efficient form. Each script provides detailed comments regarding the use of the web scraping function.
